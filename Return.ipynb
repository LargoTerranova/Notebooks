    "- All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit.\n",
    "- The pass statment is usefull as a placeholder which does not perform any action (null operation)\n",
    "- The parentheses are always required in a function call. If you forget them, then you won’t be calling the function but referencing it as a function object.\n",
    "- You can use any Python object as a return value. Since everything in Python is an object, you can return strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, classes, instances, user-defined objects, and even modules or packages.\n",
    "- You can omit the return value of a function and use a bare return without a return value. You can also omit the entire return statement. In both cases, the return value will be None.\n",
    "- You can only use expressions in a return statement. Expressions are different from statements like conditionals or loops.\n",
