    "- Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions.\n",
    "- A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.\n",
    "- To understand decorators, it is enough to think about functions as something that turns given arguments into a value.\n",
    "- A decorator is just a regular Python function. All the usual tools for easy reusability are available. \n",
    "- In order to understand D. you have to understand first:\n",
    "    - D. make extensive use of closures\n",
    "    - That functions are first class objects (can be passed arround)\n",
    "    - Inner Functions (are created and exist as local variables)\n",
    "    - Functions can be used as input to another function\n",
    "    - A function can be the output of another function\n"
